        <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
        <p>
            Abel Mutua Musyoki is not just a name but a beacon of creativity that has illuminated the Kenyan entertainment industry for years. Abel has become a household name known for his exceptional talent as an actor, writer, and comedian. Today, we pay tribute to this remarkable individual who has left an indelible mark on the world of Kenyan entertainment.</p>

        <h2><u>Early Life</u></h2>
        <p>Abel Mutua was born in Pumwani Maternity Hospital on August 28 1986. They lived in Umoja 1 Estate from 1986 up to 1991 when his father stepped out on them.
            After 1991, they moved to Kayole estate but later came back to Umoja. They moved to Ministry of Works Government houses in Karanja Road, Kibera in 1997 after his mother got remarried.
            He says going to live in Kibera was a downgrade in life. His star had started to dim but thanks to a girl called Milkah, his childhood sweetheart, he remained on course. He pursued his education with vigor and curiosity.
            He lived in Kibera until 2008 when he and his buddy Philip Karanja moved to Pangani Estate after having a more disposable income.
            In 2012, he moved his young family to a bigger house in Thindigua, Kiambu Road. It was this insatiable appetite for learning that led him to discover his passion for storytelling.
             His humble beginnings became the foundation upon which he would build a remarkable career.

            <h2><u>Brief Backstory</u></h2>
            <p>When Abel Mutua was 4 years, his dad bought a ‘National’ black and white TV. Abel became so much accustomed to it that the seed for his love for the screen was planted. He would remember and recite the whole KBC TV programme lineup from Sunday to Saturday. His mum would even boast to her friends about his programme line up memory.

                His love for the screen was catapulted to the skies in 1992 when their neighbour, Mr. Ochieng, went to the village for the Christmas holiday and left a Sony 14″ coloured TV with them. That is when that love for TV was sealed.
                
                This love was further catalysed by a trip their class made to the KBC TV studios.
                
                Later on in Kibera, in 1998, Abel met Ishmael Mohammed, of KBC Radio, and Presidential Press Service who rejuvenated his desire for broadcast media and pointed his desire to schooling at Kenya Institute of Mass Communication.
                
                
                Upon joining Ayany Estate Primary School in 1999, he and his friend Clifford Otieno started reenacting the then famous Redycyulass TV Show belonging to the KU students Walter Mong’are, Tony Njuguna and John Kiarie. This gave Abel early exposure to acting.
                
                Still, in the same school, he collided with a teacher called Mrs Rabut who sustained his thespian fire through a solo verse she wrote for him. This verse gave him, even more, exposure and experience in performance when he went to present it to a wider audience.
                
                When he went to Makueni Boys High School, he helped start the drama club in the school. This gave him the exposure up to the national level in the school drama festivals. This helped him to know a bit of scriptwriting and also stage presence.
                
                After completing his O level education in 2004 he enrolled to Join Kenya Institute of Mass Communication (KIMC) to pursue a Diploma in Film Production. He says he went to learn about his hobby. He majored in Camerawork.
                
                
                After he joined the institution’s drama club, called The Power House, he acted in a play that won at the National Drama competitions. This is where his talent was identified by Citizen TV and he, together with others landed on celebrity roles in the sensational TV drama Tahidi High. There he acted as Freddie.</p>
